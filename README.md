# Vada_Pav NFT Project

## Background/Info 

The improvements in blockchain technology from decentalized financial applications from orgnaizations [Ethereum2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/) providing improves from Proof-of-Work(POW) to Proof-of-Stake(POS)and [Ripple and its Liquidity Hub](https://ripple.com/lp/liquidity-hub/) which enable enterprise companies to easily and efficiently source digital assets from the broader crypto market.

## Why this project?

As a first step into dividing into the world of blockchain, and understanding the development lifecycle, I have decided to use this project to create my first NFT (smart-contract based) project. This is a hobby-project to learn about the technologies. 

## But the project is not done? Why are you posting it?

While this project is far from the complete state to achieve learning/building, it is a start to the understanding the different file system/packages and developement environment associated with this project. 

## Accountability

To make this project consistane, and improving it over time, I decided to give a week max to finish this first NFT project. It teaching skills and understanding the environment life-cycle associated with blockchain technology. 


## Why Vada-Pav?

Vada pav, alternatively spelt wada pao, is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of Maharashtra, India. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili pepper.

As a first NFT project, I have decided to use this photo of a VadaPav. Not really using this project to make any dough, but as a broke-college student would be nice, but mearly a learning tool. Hope to build from learning, and design future NFTs to be sold for value. Creating full-stack applications and more.
